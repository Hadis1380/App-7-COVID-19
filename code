Brief Description of Goal of Code:
goal of the code is that to make an servey in which users can know their probalility of having cold, flu, coronovirus, allergy based on theie response to the questions.
 
Known Issues: 
the issue is how we can distinguish beteween cold, flu, coronovirus, allergy. since these four diseases have a lot in common, it will make it
challenging that the person has coronovirus. Therefore, i provided these quetions to distinguish.
